(Also known as OOP)
Everything is an object in oop.
Data + behavior = object
Inheritance = allows you to extend classes/behavior (can reuse code)
Encapsulation = class > methods and variables.
Access modifiers = Private, default, protected and public.
Polymorphism - one interface multiple implementations.
Abstraction - differences between something? (not 100% sure)
Classes can contain: fields, initialization blocks, Constructors, methods and nested loops.
final means you cannot add anymore classes or extend it. public final something{

}
